Client Server Development


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, prioritize clear and consistent coding standards, including meaningful variable names and comprehensive comments. Leverage modular design by organizing code into functions or classes that each handle a single aspect of the program's functionality, facilitating easier updates and debugging. Employ version control systems and write unit tests to ensure changes do not break existing functionalities, enhancing adaptability and long-term maintainability.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
- Every problem has a solution. As computer scientists, we find solutions by compartmentalizing larger problems into smaller problems. In the case of the Grazioso Salvare project, this involved building an understanding of CRUD operations and then gradually building on that understanding to create a UI for the DB. What separated this assignment from previous assignments was that it required a cultivated understanding of other CS principles to create the final result. Knowing how to read the MongoDB and Plotly docs and fundamental OOP principles was crucial to the assignment's success.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
- This project gave me a general understanding of how to connect a database to a UI however, for future projects I'll have to dive in more on adding layers of abstraction to prevent direct access to the DB.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
- Computer scientists keep the world moving. Hospitals, banks, airplanes, cell phones, and so much more are built with the help of computer scientists. Without computer scientists, the world would likely not be as connected as it is today.
