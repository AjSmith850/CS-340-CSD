Client Server Development


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
- To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, prioritize clear and consistent coding standards, including meaningful variable names and comprehensive comments. Leverage modular design by organizing code into functions or classes that each handle a single aspect of the program's functionality, facilitating easier updates and debugging. Employ version control systems and write unit tests to ensure changes do not break existing functionalities, enhancing adaptability and long-term maintainability.
